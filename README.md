# Password Generator Starter Code

# <Password_generator>

## Description

- As a programmer, I wanted to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected.
- I built this application so that it will run in browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.
- Writing this code gave me expierence learning how to apply javasript and to see how it manipulates functionaly to the user interface.
- While working on this project, I learned how to use the console to check for bugs and work them out. I also gained a basic understading of how to apply javascript such as using the javaScript HTML DOM EventListener & creating arrays. 


## Installation

To get the project up and running simply clone this Git Hub repository, then open index.html with a live server of choice.
